## Authentication Flow

1. new users register with username/password

    ```
    Username: memelover22 
    Password: passW0rd11
    ```

 2. passwords are hashed before saving

    ```
    password: passW0rd11 ---> hash function ---> hashed password: $2b$10$eYd0srg8ZhEcf9XbdFKGp.WadQod2z0wzj10P/SX/6KGd.Za9x.9C
    ```

 3. login return JWT with the userâ€™s ID and role encoded

    ```
    {
    "id": 4,
    "username": "memelover22",
    "password": "$2b$10$eYd0srg8ZhEcf9XbdFKGp.WadQod2z0wzj10P/SX/6KGd.Za9x.9C"
    }
    ```

    ```
    Regular users: can create, update, delete their own memes; like/unlike memes.
    Admin users: can delete any meme or user.

    ```

    4. protected routes require: 
    ``` 
    Authorization: Bearer <token> 
    ```
